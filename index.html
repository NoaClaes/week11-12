			<h3>Who am I</h3>
			<img class="ik" src="ik.jpg" alt="">

			<p class="mywork" > <span class="dropcap2" >M</span>y name is Noa Claes. I'm a first year student at the AP Hogeschool in Antwerp. I always loved to be creative and decided to do something with this love after six years of studying sports and science. I am really happy with the choice of study I made and hope to learn a lot more in the two following years.</p>

			<p class="mywork" > <span class="dropcap" >W</span>hen I was younger, I always loved drawing. During my time in High School I stopped because I didn't have enough time. Now that I am studying Graphic and Digital Media I picked up my old hobby and started making digital portraits. I share all my portraits on my Instagram account where I get weekly request of people asking to draw a portrait of them.</p>

			<h3>Interviews</h3>
			<h4>The Collective: Ode to Virtuoso</h4>
			<p class="interview" > <h6>Ode to Virtuoso is a weekly interview series conducted and created by novelist, poet and writer M. G. Hughes. The purpose of Ode to Virtuoso (Ode to the Artist) is to uproot the background stories of emerging artists and voices in the arts. <br>
			Requests to be featured in Ode to Virtuose will not be accepted as my primary goal is to present a diverse array of voices, stories, and art that have personally impacted me. <br> </h6>

			Based in Antwerp, Belgium, Noa was always creative but “never did anything with it”. She studied Science in high school and, after graduating in 2018, decided it was time to pursue something she truly loved. That thing was graphic design and digital media. <br>
			As she mentioned in our conversation, “When someone asked if I could make an illustration for him I did not find myself good enough and didn’t know how to start. <br>
			Eventually I started practicing more, making portraits of my little sister and others using my computer. <br>
			“Just last week, though, I bought an iPad and started doing my work on there. And now I’m shar- ing on here (instagram) so I can recieve feedback and connect with other artists.” <br> </h7>
			<h8>“When I was little I always loved to paint and draw and create things. One of my first memories of creating something was with my Mom. She would draw these characters from my favorite books and I would color them in. Then we would put them on ice cream sticks and play around.”
			When I asked Noa what inspires her the most, she responded with the following:
			“People who have their own specific style. I love it when you can come across something (a draw- ing, painting or picture) and know it was from that particular artist.” <br> </h8>

			<h9><span class="quote">“When you can recognize someone’s love for their work, it makes it a hundred times more beautiful.”</span></h9>

			<h10>“Is anyone else in your family artistic?” I asked. <br>
			“Yes! But everyone is artistic in their own way. My Mom is very
			creative in her job and my Dad is a very good photographer. I also have an aunt who can paint fairly well. Then there’s my sister and nephew who are studying to become architects.” <br> </h10>
			<h11>I came here to the final question. “Are you aiming to create a career out of this?” <br>
			“With my studies I am really hoping to pursue a professional career in the arts”, says Noa. “I really love to draw and will always keep doing this, and if I could also earn a little money in the process, that would of course be very nice. <br>
		</p> </h11>
		<h12><span class="quote">I think it’s important to commit to a job that you are passionate about.” </span></h12>
